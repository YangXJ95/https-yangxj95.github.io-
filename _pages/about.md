I am a fourth-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, working under the guidance of Prof. Ashis Banerjee. My research primarily focuses on advanced robot perception, with a particular emphasis on 3D vision technologies. While centered on these core areas, the principles and techniques I'm developing could have broader relevance across the landscape of emerging technologies, such as AR, VR or autonomous systems. I am interesting in developing specialized, efficient solutions that can operate with minimal computational resources, enabling real-time performance on lightweight computing platforms such as edge devices. My work aims to bridge the gap between sophisticated perception algorithms and their practical implementation in resource-constrained environments.
